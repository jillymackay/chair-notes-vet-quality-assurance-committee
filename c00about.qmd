# Guiding Principles

This document arises from my maternity leave. When I returned from maternity leave, I realised that I hadn't left very good instructions

I am personally guided by the idea that [Quality Assurance is Not a Morally Neutral Concept](https://jillymackay.com/post/moral-quality-assurance/).

To that end, I am influenced by the open access principles.

QA Scotland's Enhancement Framework

The University of Edinburgh's guidance.
